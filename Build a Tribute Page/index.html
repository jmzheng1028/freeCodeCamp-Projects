    <div class="small-caption">The robotic helmets worn by Thomas Bangalter and Guy Manuel de Homem Christo are some of the most iconic outfits of any artist in recent years. The helmets are ever-evolving masks that have left fans intrigued by the mystery of the faces behind them. Since 2001, whenever they appear in public or perform live, the two Parisians conceal their identities by wearing these elaborate headpieces. Thomas Bangalter’s helmet is typically made of sleek chrome with a simple LED display, while Guy Manuel’s helmet is a masterpiece in gold with bright and colourful displays.</div>

      <h5>Here is a list of Daft Punk's studio albums: </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
         
        <li><strong>January 1997:</strong> <i>Homework</i>            

          <p  style="color: #484848  "><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/Daftpunk-homework.jpg" align="right"  class="img-responsive album-img" >The album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that were intended to be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good enough for an album.</p></li>
        
        <li><strong>March 2001:</strong> <i>Discovery</i>  
          <p style="color: #484848  "><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Daft_Punk_-_Discovery.jpg" align="right"  class="img-responsive album-img" >The album marks a shift in the sound from Chicago house which they were previously known for to disco, post-disco, garage house, and synthpop-inspired house. The album later became the soundtrack of the anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, a collaboration between Daft Punk, Leiji Matsumoto, and Toei Animation.</p></li>
        
        <li><strong>March 2005:</strong> <i>Human After All</i>  
          <p style="color: #484848  "><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/Humanafterall.jpg" align="right"  class="img-responsive album-img" >With this album, the duo took a more minimalistic and improvisational approach to their music using a mixture of guitars and electronics. <i>Human After All</i> received mixed reviews from critics, who derided its minimalistic and repetitive nature and its reported six-week creation, which was particularly short compared to the production of Discovery and Homework.[5] </p></li>
        <li><strong>May 2013:</strong> <i>Random Access Memories</i>  
          <p style="color: #484848  "><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Random_Access_Memories.jpg" align="right"  class="img-responsive album-img" >The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements and a web series.</p>
          <p style="color: #484848  "><i>Random Access Memories</i> is one of Daft Punk's most commercially successful albums, topping the charts in more than 25 countries worldwide. It was their first album to top the United States Billboard 200 chart, selling more than 339,000 copies within its first week. The lead single "Get Lucky" was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in more than 30 countries and becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.

      <p>Looking at robots is not like looking at an idol. It’s not a human being, so it’s more like a mirror - the energy people send to the stage bounces back and everybody has a good time together rather than focusing on us.</p>
